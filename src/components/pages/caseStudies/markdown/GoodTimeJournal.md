## What is Good Time Journal?

Good Time Journal is a product that aims to help users improve their lives. Our model is based off the research from Stanford's Design Your Life course.

## Technical Obstacles

### Design

At the initial design of the application, we had a blank slate. No styling or designs provided to us. As developers, we had to not only utilize our programming knowledge, but also dive into creating custom UI/UX components. 

We considered many options when creating a user interface, but we eventually decided on a minimalist theme. Colors were kept to a minimum, and the most relevant information pushed front and center, as pictured below.

### Logic

The hardest part of creating this application was our dynamic multi-step questionnaire. A core idea behind Designing Your Life is journaling your thoughts and reflecting upon them. 

This is why we focused our energy on designing a pleasant and usable user interface for this part of the application.

This multi-step process required us to save data to our state and allow for users to go back and fourth with ease. Once the form is submitted, all data is captured and sent to our API. 

## Reflection

This was my first project I designed with a team and it was a pleasant experience. If I had to go back and do it again, I'd focus on making our code more succinct. We had a deadline of building this project in 1 week, so we skipped out a bit on best practices to a more `just get things done` mentality.  

The design and implementation was a great learning experience for me and my team. We implemented a variety of features in a very short time window. If you ever need a walkthrough of this project and how it is built, feel free to contact me [hello@brandonlent.com](mailto:hello@brandonlent.com).
